## Introduction

This space is an open platform for sharing writeups on challenges. Whether the challenge is from Web, Crypto, Pwn, or any other category, feel free to contribute your detailed explanations and methodologies.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a new **branch** for your writeup submission.
4. Place your writeup in the appropriate directory (e.g., `Web/<challenge_name>/writeups/<yourname>/*`, `Crypto/<challenge_name>/writeups/<yourname>/*`, `Pwn/<challenge_name>/writeups/<yourname>/*`, etc.).
5. Commit your changes and open a **Pull Request**.

Even if your writeup isn't perfect, your contributions help the community learn and grow. Every submission is valuable!

## Directory Structure

Organize your writeups by your name to make navigation easier:

- `<your name>/README.md` – Your personal README containing an introduction and summary of your writeups.
- `<your name>/solver/` – Directory for your solver scripts, tools, or any automation code used in solving challenges.
- `<your name>/img/` – Directory for images such as screenshots, diagrams, or other visual aids.

### Example

If your name is `dimas`, the directory structure might look like this:

```
dimas/
├── README.md
├── solver/
│   └── exploit.py
└── img/
    └── challenge1.png
```
